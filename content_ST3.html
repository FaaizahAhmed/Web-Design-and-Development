<h2 id="causes">Main Causes of Climate Change</h2>
<!-- Content about the main causes of climate change -->
<p>One of the main causes of Climate Change is cutting down forests. Cutting down forests to make farms or pastures, produces emissions because cutting down trees releases the carbon they have been storing. As trees absorb CO2, deforestation reduces nature's ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere. Another main cause of climate change is manufacturing goods. This is because manufacturing and industry generate emissions, the majority of which come from the combustion of fossil fuels to make cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothing, and other products. Mining and other industrial operations also produce gases. Another main cause of climate change is generating power. The use of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas to generate power and heat contributes significantly to world emissions. The majority of power is still produced using fossil fuels; just around a quarter comes from wind, solar, and other renewable sources. Lastly, another main cause of climate change is powering buildings. Residential and commercial buildings account for more than half of total global power use. As they continue to utilize coal, oil, and natural gas for heating and cooling, they generate enormous amounts of greenhouse gases.</p>

<h2 id="effects">Effects of Climate Change</h2>
<!-- Content about the effects of climate change -->
<div>
<p>There are many effects of climate change, some of which consists of increased droughts. Water is getting limited in many areas. Droughts may cause severe sand and dust storms, which can transport billions of tons of sand over continents. Deserts are increasing, decreasing available space for food production. Many individuals areÂ at risk of not having adequate water on a regular basis. Another effect of climate change is hotter temperatures. Almost every geographical area is seeing more hot days and heat waves; 2020 was one of the warmest years on record. Higher temperatures exacerbate heat-related problems and make it more difficult to work and move about. When temperatures rise, wildfires spread more readily and quickly. Another effect of climate change is not enough food. This is significant because climate change and increased extreme weather events are contributing to a global increase in hunger and malnutrition. Fisheries crops and animals may be damaged or rendered less productive. Heat stress may reduce water and pastures suitable for grazing. Lastly, another effect of climate change is poverty and displacement. Climate change worsens the variables that cause and maintain people in poverty. Floods have the potential to completely demolish urban slums, eradicating houses and livelihoods. Working outside might be challenging due to the heat. Weather-related catastrophes displaced 23 million people per year, making them more susceptible to poverty.</p>

<h2 id="solutions">Potential Solutions</h2>
<!-- Content about potential solutions to climate change -->
<p>Investing in renewable energy is one approach to help save climate change. This is because transitioning to clean and renewable energy is the most effective strategy to phase out the usage of fossil fuels. These include technologies such as solar, wind, wave, tidal, and geothermal energy. Another way we can save climate change is by protecting the forest, like Amazon. Forests are critical in the battle against climate change, and maintaining them is a key climate solution. Cutting down forests on an industrial basis damages massive trees that could be absorbing enormous quantities of carbon. However, enterprises remove forests to make space for livestock farms, soya, and palm oil plantations. Governments may prevent them by enacting stronger legislation. Another way to help prevent climate change is by switching to sustainable transport. This is because both diesel and petrol cars, as well as planes and ships, run on fossil fuels. Reducing car use, moving to electric cars, and limiting air travel would not only help to combat climate change, but will also cut air pollution.</p>
